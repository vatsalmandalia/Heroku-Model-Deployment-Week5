# Heroku Model Deployment of Life Expectancy Prediction Model-Week5

This repository contains the necessary files like model.pickle, app.py, requirements.txt, Procfile, runtime.txt and a separate templates folder.

model.pickle - This is the linear regression model which is converted into a pickle file to allow deployment
app.py - Flask application required for model deployment
Procfile - This gives the process of how the Heroku app will run.
requirements.txt - This contains the necessary dependencies, i.e. libraries and their versions, which would be needed to deploy the flask app on Heroku.
runtime.txt - This gives the runtime version of Python used on the local machine.

The final file is a pdf 'Week 5 - API and Cloud based Deployment.pdf' which contains the step-by-step process of the deployment of the Life Expectancy Prediction end-to-end model on the open source cloud platform called Heroku.
